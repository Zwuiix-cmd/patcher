# Patcher

**Patcher** is a mod for Minecraft Bedrock Edition that improves gameplay with features not found in the game. This mod is intended for people who don't necessarily want to have a PvP client injected (due to fps loss).

### How to use ?
We recommend using [ModLoader](https://github.com/alteik/ModLoader) from [alteik](https://github.com/alteik) to automatically load the __.dll__ into your game.
Or you can simply inject it using any DLL injector (FateInjector, HorionInjector, Process Hacker, and others).

### How to use with ModLoader ?
Install [ModLoader](https://github.com/alteik/ModLoader) then insert the __.dll__ into your mods folder at this location: “%APPDATA%/Minecraft Bedrock/mods”. You can access it by entering this path in Win+R.
When you launch your game, a patcherconf.json file will be created with the various modules present in the patcher.

# Recommended mod
We also recommend using [ForceCloseOreUI](https://github.com/alteik/ForceCloseOreUI) for a better experience when changing servers or performing other actions. This allows you to disable [OreUI](https://github.com/Mojang/ore-ui).
